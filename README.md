CHANGE LOG AND BUG FIXES

04/04/2016 Program crashes if internet is not available when the program starts and looks for updates online. An 
	exception was placed around the http lib in the SOURCE CODE (Still need to re-compile). If internet is not
	present the program should not crash and continue as expected.
